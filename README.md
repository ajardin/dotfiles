# My Dotfiles

The easiest way to use the content of this repository is to clone it on your local machine (e.g. `~/.dotfiles`), and
then run the various setup scripts provided by the `Makefile`. :wink:

> Keep in mind, that these are my personal settings. You should check that they suit your needs.

:point_right: If you want to use the same configuration as me, you can use the `Makefile` targets. Otherwise, you can
just copy the files you want.
